        <h1>Clinical Trials and You</h1>
        <article id="faqWrap">
            <h2>What Are clinical trials?</h2>
            <p>Clinical trials help us learn more about ways to prevent or
                treat medical conditions. Research must show a study medicine is safe and effective 
                before it can be approved for use. Without these clinical research studies and 
                the volunteers who take part in them, modern medicine would not exist.
            </p>
            <p>
            Researchers are required to follow strict rules to make sure that participants are safe. 
            These rules are enforced by the Federal Government. Each clinical trial also follows a careful 
            study plan or protocol that describes what the researchers will do. The principal investigator, or head researcher, is responsible for making sure that the protocol is followed.
            </p>
            <h2>Safety in our Reserch</h2>
            <p>We are committed to protecting the people who take part in our clinical trials, and
                to upholding the highest ethical standards as we seek safe and effective ways to prevent or treat diseases.
            </p>
            <h2>Clinical trial: Benefits</h2>
            <p>You may ask yourself, "Why should I try something that researchers are not sure will work?" 
                That is a good question. Being part of a clinical trial may have risks, but it may also have benefits. 
                Past clinical trial history has led many to hesitate to sign up for research. 
                However, today there are strict rules in place to keep your health and privacy safe.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You may get a new treatment for a disease before it is available to everyone.</li>
                <li>Researchers may provide you with medical care and more frequent health check-ups as part of your treatment.</li>
                <li>You may have the chance to help others get a better treatment for their health problems in the future.</li>
                <li>You may be able to get information about support groups and resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Clinical Trial: Risks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The new treatment may cause serious side effects or be uncomfortable.</li>
                <li>The new treatment may not work, or it may not be better than the standard treatment.</li>
                <li>You may NOT be part of the treatment group (or experimental group) that gets the new treatmentâ€”for example, a new drug or device. Instead, you may be part of the control group, which means you get the standard treatment or a no-treatment placebo.</li>
                <li>medical appointments could take a lot of time. You might need to travel to the study site several times or stay in the hospital.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Your Rights as a participant</h2>
            <h4>As a participant you have many rights; among them:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You may leave a Study at any time</li>
                <li>Be told the goal of the study</li>
                <li>Be told all risks and benefits of the study</li>
                <li>Know who has access to your collected data</li>
                <li>Have your identity remain confidential and understand your protections</li>
                <li>Ask about any aspect of study</li>
            </ul>
